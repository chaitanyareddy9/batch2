Give me some idea on what is a Data type. What are Primitive Data types and Non-Primitive Data types. Explain with some examples.

A data type defines the kind of data a variable can hold, such as integers, characters, and determines the operations that can be performed on that data.

Primitive data types:
Primitive data types are the most basic data types available in a programming language
They are predefined by the language and named by a keyword.
Number
String
Big int
Null
Boolean
undefined

Non-Primitive data types:
Non-primitive data types are more complex data types and can be derived from primitive data types.
class
object
function
array
map
set
